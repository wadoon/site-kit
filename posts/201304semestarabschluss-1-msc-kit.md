Here my little conclusion of the last semester (WS12/13). My first semester at
the Karlsruher Institute of Technology in the study path for M.Sc. 

My lectures were:

  * VF 1: Theoretische Grundlagen
    * *Advanced Datastructures* -- should be deeper in the analytical section
      and show more techniques and tools than explizit data structures. BADS'13
      was nice.
	  
    * Formale Systeme -- Stammmodule - very dry topic and a good pace at the
      end, where it get excited (Büchi-Automata and Model-Checking)
	  

  * VF 14: Kognitive Systeme
    * Automatische Sichtprüfung und Bildverarbeitung -- nice lecture, but the
	focus is to much into the optics and physics (computer scientist solve
	problems in the computer, not before)
	

    * Einführung in die Informationsfusion -- My benefit was not to much during
      this lecture- very dry but involed docent. The last section - more
      interresting - get very short and the probabilistic methods get too long.
	  
    * Maschinelles Lernen I -- Too much topics, nothing in deep - but a nice
	overview
	
  * Wahlfach:
    * Telematik -- »duty" lecture« -- nearly the same content as Rechnernetze in
      the second semester.
	  
  * EF: Biomedizinische Messtechnik
    * *Biomedizinische Messtechnik I* -- should be interresting, but was boring - docent was not well prepared* 
    * *Bildgebende Verfahren der Medizin I* -- a very fast speed during the lecture and high workload for 3 ECTS.


I visited courses for 32 ECTS. I did exam in 27 ECTS. 
In conclusion: The workload is not presented in ECTS well. The exams are based
upon powerpoint slides, so you learn stupid bullet points.

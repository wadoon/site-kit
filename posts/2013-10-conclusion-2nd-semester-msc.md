Here my little conclusion of the summer semester 2013.
It was my second semester at the Karlsruher Institute of Technology in the study path for M.Sc. in Computer Science.

I visited the following lectures (I keep the original titles):

  * VF 1: Theoretische Grundlagen
    * *Formale Systeme II* (formal systems) -- nice course with script
    * *Anwendung formaler Verifikation mit Ãœbung* (applied formal verification) -- could be better, more content and harder excercises should be a good beginning
    * *Unscharfe Mengen* (fuzzy set/logic) -- a good and theoretical start into fuzzy logic/sets. A split in two lectures (with more content) is planned.
    * *Textindexierung* (text indexing) -- In this year, this was not very deep. The most things was self-explaining.

  * VF 14: Kognitive Systeme
    * *Kognitive Systeme* (cognitive systems)-- [Stammmodule] Overview about speech/image processing and robotics. In my opinion the materials of speech processing should rewritten and the excercises are far far away from the lecture.
    * *Medizinische Simulationssysteme II*   (medical simulation system II) -- a good lecture on a very new topic (for computer scientist)
    * *Neuronale Netze* (neuronal nets) -- I hoped of a more theoretical lecture with more content.

  * Wahlfach:
    * Seminar in Ambient Assisted Living -- A seminar of horror.
    * B.1 Science -- An useless english course for me.

  * EF: Biomedizinische Messtechnik
    * *Biomedizinische Messtechnik II* -- The same bad lecturing style as the predessor course.
    * *Bioelektrische Signale* -- A good course; similiar in style I know from my old university.

My credit account is 68 credits now. For my third semester I only need
22 points in addition to my master thesis. But I have a lot of
constraints to satisfy for seminars and key competences. From the 22
points I only need to hear 16 points.

So my next lectures will be:

exam only:
  * Biomedizinische Messtechnik I  (3 credits)
  * Biomedizinische Messtechnik II (3 credits)
  * Fortgeschrittene Datenstrukturen	(5 credits, because I need to get the
  module full)

hearing and exam:
  * Physologie und Anatomie I  (3 credits)
  * Praktikum (6 credits)
  * Seminar (3 credits)
  * key competences (4 credits)

After this I will have 95 credits (five more than needed) and no room
for Medizinische Simulations I+II.
